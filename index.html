		This is a visualizer for your predicted gender and age numbers from events-*.json from your Discord Data Package.
		</p>
		<p>
		Here's how to use it:

		<ol start="0">
			<li>Get your Discord Data Package.
				<a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004027692-Requesting-a-Copy-of-your-Data">Here's</a>
				how to do it.
				<br>
				Spoiler: It can take up to several days. When you receive it in the mail, come back!
			</li>
			<li>Unpack the zip you got into a folder somewhere</li>
			<li>
				<label for="directory-picker">Select the <b>package/activity/analytics</b> directory
					inside your unpacked package</label>
				<button id="directory-picker" onclick="evaluatePython()" disabled>Pick Directory</button>
			</li>
			<li>
				<label for="runbutton">Push this button when it becomes active</label>
				<button id="runbutton" disabled>CRUNCH THE DATA</button>
			</li>
		</ol>

			<summary>What is it?</summary>
			It is a site (program) that graphs your Discord data from a file
			from your Discord Data Package, fully on-device.
		</details>
		<details>
			<summary>Why is it?</summary>
			I wanted a write a simple site to point my friends to to view their 
			Discord data. Cause it is fun to look at what Discord thinks about 
			your gender and age.
			<br>
			Not everyone has python installed, and this site
			is basically equivalent to a python script, but it runs in a
			browser, and works fully locally.
		</details>
		<details>
			<summary>How does it work?</summary>
			You provide a directory, a Python script opens the events-*.json
			file and plots the data with matplotlib.
			And it doesn't send nor store any of your data!
			Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/rebane2001">rebane2001</a>
			for writing a
			<a href="https://gist.github.com/rebane2001/b0256bde6b999d9477938d5a968ded5c">gist</a>
			by which this plotting script is heavily inspired.
			<br>
			Under the hood it uses PyOdide runtime (WASM) which conveniently
			bundles several popular Python packages, including matplotlib.
			<details>
				<summary>Huh? So it works fully on-device?</summary>
				You can see the source code for yourself. It pulls PyOdide 
				runtime from a CDN, and the python script is in /script.py, so
				feel welcome to check it out yourself.
